new jobs on our job board. Delete someone elses old job in time to not get yourself killed or

## Requirements

1. Access a Sqlite3 database using Active Record.
2. You should have a minimum of two models with a one to many relationship.
3. You should build out a simple **React** frontend to give your user 3 of the 4
   CRUD abilities for at least one of your resources. For example, build out a
   todo list. A user should be able to create a new todo, see all todos,
   update a todo item, and delete a todo. Todos can be grouped into categories,
   so that a todo has many categories and categories have many todos.
4. Use good OO design patterns. You should have separate classes for your
   models.

## Getting Started

First, cd into the `backend` folder and run `bundle install` in your backend
folder to install your gems.

**Start your server with:**

```
shotgun --port=9292
```

> **Note:** This will run your server on port
> [http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292).
> [shotgun](https://github.com/rtomayko/shotgun) is a ruby gem that will
> automatically reload your Rack server. You may still need to refresh your
> browser to see changes.

**Start up the front-end**

Next, cd into the `front-end` folder and run :
```
npm start 
```
